no idea, actually......
But how can i install my AutoScript plugin here? 
I guess it's impossible (xiaosile)

Can you use terminal here?
you should be able to see that i am using ghci
the storage is persistant, the workspace will *resume* from where you left off

True
I can't use terminal though.

That makes sense, or this is useless.

can you create a vscode plugin project here?
you probably want to sign in Already did


i think it's `yo code`
actually, i think you could open a 

terminal for your self?

TRUE THING

you should be able to use it now
it seems that i need to manually 

if you could make a vscode plugin for autoscript, this will then work
lol, that's true
I don't if I could pull off a hack for the workspace
lol

oh, well that's overwhelming for me
lol
I'll keep the Sublime option for now. Scalable and simple
lol true

but maybe discussing code here is easier than google doc, lol

absolutely
that's why i wish the plugin works here.

fxxk, the lagging is driving me mad
editor-wise is fine.
i mean terminal.
it's just like dead 笑死
but this is always a favorable option for us.

yes
now i could use either vscode workspace or local linux machine on galaxy s9+.
lol, samsung is really the "you next laptop doesn't have to be a laptop"
largely because android's openness.

so kul

ok i'll try starting a workspace and import the plugin.

So kool
but i didn't find the entry for online workspace.
I tried vscode.dev but it won't let me open the terminal.

How did you get into the workspace?

yeah, you could start one for 
our own, just create a github repo,
open vscode.dev

I guess it's dead too...


it's lagging a lot back in china?
I have around 6ms delay.


But the plugin is up to change everyday.
It would be so <annoying class=""></annoying> 笑死了
It works tho
